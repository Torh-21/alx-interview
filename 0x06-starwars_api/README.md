This is the ALX Interview - StarWars API Project
The script prints all characters of a Star Wars movie using the following constraints:
- The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”
- Display one character name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint
- You must use the Star wars API
- You must use the request module
